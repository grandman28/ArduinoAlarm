# Arduino Alarm System

My project idea begins from the idea of anti theft devices. Using an Arduino Uno board and some sensors I made a system which detects the proximity of an intruder and starts a loud sound and 2 flashing LEDs. The alarm can be disabled via remote control and RFID card, so that the user has to both know the password AND have the correct card/tag for disabling the alarm. More about the project can be found in the documentation and/or in the video.

This project was made for the Linear Electronic Circuits subject
